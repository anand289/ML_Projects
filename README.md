1. House Rates with Bostom Data (Linear Regression):Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.</br>
</br>
She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!</br>
</br>

Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.</br>

The data contains the following columns:</br>
</br>
'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.</br>
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city</br>
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city</br>
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city</br>
'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at</br>
'Address': Address for the house</br>

2. Ecommerce (Linear Regression): You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.</br>

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!</br>

Just follow the steps below to analyze the customer data (it's fake, don't worry I didn't give you real credit card numbers or emails).</br>

3. Titanic (Logistic Regression): We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased. Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.</br>

We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.</br>

4. Advertising (Logistic Regression): In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.</br>

This data set contains the following features:</br>

'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes</br>
'Age': cutomer age in years</br>
'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer</br>
'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet</br>
'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement</br>
'City': City of consumer</br>
'Male': Whether or not consumer was male</br>
'Country': Country of consumer</br>
'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window</br>
'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
</br>
</br>

5. Classfied Data (K Nearest Neighbors): You've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.</br>

We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.</br>
</br>

6. Classified Data Project(KNN): Similar to 5

7. Kyphosis(Trees and random forest)

8. Loans(Trees and random forest)

9. SVM Inbuilt data
